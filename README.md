# python-demo-dates
Demo of some concepts using the datetime and calendar libraries in Python.

## Getting Started: 

Download or clone this repo. 

Set up and start the virtual environment. 

```
$ virtualenv -p "$(which python3)" venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
(If you only have python3 on your computer, use `which python` instead.) 

Then install the requirements:

```
$ (venv) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can open a Python shell like ipython or the one in your IDE and play with the functions in `src`. To run the program from the command line: 

```
$ (venv) python example.py
```

To run the tests: 

```
$ (venv) pytest
```
